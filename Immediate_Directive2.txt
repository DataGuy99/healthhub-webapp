# Claude CLI: Life Optimization Engine - Phase 2 Insights & Correlation Engine

## üß† PHASE 2: HEALTH-SUPPLEMENT CORRELATION & INSIGHTS GENERATION

**CRITICAL FOUNDATION**: With health data now flowing, we build the intelligence layer that identifies patterns between supplements, health metrics, and spending.

## üéØ PHASE OBJECTIVES

**Primary Goal**: Create a sophisticated correlation engine that identifies meaningful relationships between supplement intake and measurable health improvements, then connects these to financial optimization.

**Success Metrics**:
- Identify 3+ statistically significant supplement-health correlations
- Generate actionable health optimization suggestions
- Provide budget-aware supplement recommendations
- Create predictive models for optimal supplement timing

## üîç CORRELATION ENGINE ARCHITECTURE

### **Data Pipeline Integration**

**Health Data Stream**: Continuous health metrics from Phase 1
- Heart rate variability (HRV) with 1Hz granularity
- Sleep stages with transition timestamps
- Stress levels with contextual data
- Activity metrics with intensity scoring

**Supplement Data Stream**: Detailed intake logs from existing system
- Supplement type and dosage
- Exact intake timestamps
- Frequency patterns (daily, workout, custom)
- Cost per dose calculations

**Financial Data Stream**: Spending patterns from finance module
- Supplement purchase costs
- Health-related expenses
- Budget allocations by category
- Purchase timing and bulk discounts

### **Correlation Analysis Framework**

**Statistical Methods to Implement:**

1. **Time-Series Correlation Analysis**
   - Cross-correlation with lag detection
   - Moving window analysis (7-day, 14-day, 30-day windows)
   - Seasonal decomposition for long-term patterns
   - Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)

2. **Health Impact Scoring System**
   ```typescript
   interface HealthImpactScore {
     metric: string;                    // "hrv", "sleep_efficiency", "stress_level"
     baseline_average: number;          // Pre-supplement average
     post_supplement_average: number;   // Post-supplement average
     improvement_percentage: number;    // Percentage improvement
     statistical_significance: number;  // P-value
     confidence_level: number;          // 0-100 scale
     effect_size: number;               // Cohen's d for practical significance
   }
   ```

3. **Multi-Metric Correlation Matrix**
   - Heart Rate Variability correlation with supplement timing
   - Sleep quality correlation with evening supplements
   - Stress level correlation with adaptogenic supplements
   - Recovery rate correlation with post-workout supplements

### **Advanced Correlation Techniques**

**Machine Learning Integration (Lightweight):**
- Simple linear regression for trend identification
- Moving average crossovers for timing optimization
- Outlier detection for anomalous responses
- Pattern recognition for individual response profiles

**Contextual Analysis:**
- Exercise correlation (pre/post workout effectiveness)
- Sleep timing correlation (morning vs evening supplements)
- Meal timing correlation (with/without food effects)
- Stress level correlation (high stress day responses)

  cost_per_health_point: number;
  recommendation: "continue" | "optimize" | "discontinue" | "increase";
  alternative_suggestions: string[];
}
```

**Purchase Timing Optimization:**

- Predict optimal reorder timing based on usage patterns
- Suggest cost-effective alternatives with similar benefits
- Recommend timing purchases with budget cycles

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    supplement_id UUID REFERENCES supplements(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    health_metric TEXT NOT NULL,
    correlation_coefficient NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    p_value NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    effect_size NUMERIC NOT NULL,

    const supplementLogs = await this.getSupplementLogs(userId, supplementId, timeWindow);
    
    // Fetch health data for same period
    const healthData = await this.getHealthData(userId, timeWindow);
    
    // Perform correlation analysis
    const correlations = this.calculateCorrelations(supplementLogs, healthData);
    
    // Statistical significance testing
    const significance = this.testStatisticalSignificance(correlations);
    
    // Generate actionable insights
    const insights = this.generateInsights(correlations, significance);
    
    return {
      supplement: supplementId,
